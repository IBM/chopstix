Usage: chop disasm [<options>] [<modules>..]

Disassemble a list of modules, i.e. object files.
Checks the database if no modules are given. This step
is mandatory to populate the database with information
form the binary. This includes the functions, basic
blocks and instructions.

Options:
  -data <path>                Use database in path (default: chop.db).
  -arch <x86|ppc|sysz|riscv>  Change the ISA to <arch>. Support tools for disassembling
                              are automatically search in the $PATH.
  -ignore <pattern>           Libraries whose name matches the pattern will be ignored
                              (not disassembled). This can be useful to ignore system
                              libraries. To ignore 'libc' for example use the pattern
                              '%libc%'. This option is ignored if modules are provided
                              manually. <pattern> should be a regular expression in
                              SQLite.
                              (default: %libc%,%ld%).

Usage: chop trace [-module <name>] -begin <addr> -end <addr>
                  [<options>] <command> [<args>]
       chop trace -active <time> -interval <time>
                  [<options>] <command> [<args>]
        
Trace page accesses of a given command. The provided command 
is executed and the memory and/or code pages being executed 
are dumped to the provided path. You need to use the
'chop-trace2mpt' post-processing script to convert the trace 
to a MPT file. 

There are 3 alternative tracing methods to select the portion
of execution to be traced:

a) Region of interest, if you know the start and ending addreses
   of the region to be traced. E.g.:
    
   chop trace -begin 400 -end 800 ./foo bar baz

   will trace starting at address 0x400 and ending at addres 0x800.
   This process is repeated, and different traces are generated,
   until a termination condition is met.

b) Temporal-based sampling. The execution will be traced at the
   specified interval regions. E.g.:

   chop trace -active 5ms -interval 100ms ./foo bar baz

   will wait for 100ms, then will be tracing for 5ms and repeat 
   again. This process is repeated, and different traces are generated,
   until a termination condition is met.

c) Hybrid approach, where you want to do temporal-based sampling
   but bounded by the region of interest. E.g.:
   
   chop trace -begin 400 -end 800 -active 5ms -interval 100ms ./foo bar baz

    will wait for 100ms, then it will start tracing when address 0x400
    is reached. Then, will trace for at least 5ms, and it will stop 
    tracing when address 0x800 is reached.  This process is repeated, 
    and different traces are generated, until a termination condition is met.

Options:

  -begin <addr>          Begin address of the region of interest in hex format.
                         Address correspond to static image address of the modules
                         being executed.
  -end <addr>            End address of the region of interest in hex format.
                         Address correspond to static image address of the modules
                         being executed.
  -module <name>         Name of module to trace. This is always mandatory for Z
                         backend or if the module to trace is not the main
                         module.
  -active <time>         Time tracing is active. By default <time> is in seconds. 
                         One can use time specifiers as following: d (days), h
                         (hours), m(minutes), s(seconds), ms (milliseconds), 
                         us(microseconds). This time also includes the time
                         required to trace (dump to disk and other IO).
  -interval <time>       Time between traces. By default <time> is in seconds. 
                         One can use time specifiers as following: d (days), h
                         (hours), m(minutes), s(seconds), ms (milliseconds), 
                         us(microseconds). 
  -prob <pct>            Probability that a given region is traced
                         Valid values: floats between 0 and 1. 0: no region
                         is going to be traced. 1: all region will be traced.
  -group <num>           Group <num> region into one trace (default: 1).
  -no-save               Disable data page content dumping.
  -no-code               Disable code page content dumping.
  -no-registers          Disable register content dumping.
  -no-maps               Disable memory map dumping.
  -no-info               Disable additional information dumping.
  -trace-dir <path>      Path to directory where tracing data will be stored
                         (default: trace_data).
  -gzip                  Zip page contents.
  -log-path <path>       Path to log file.
  -log-level <level>     Set verbosity of the log file (default: info)
                         Options are: debug,verbose,info,warn,error.
  -max-pages <num>       Stop tracing after <num> pages have been extracted.
  -max-traces <num>      Stop tracing after <num> traces have been extracted.
  -access-only           Generate 'trace.bin' file in -trace-dir path. The
                         binary file is a trace containind the addresses of
                         the pages being accessed. It can be processed with 
                         'chop-detrace' helper tool. (experimental)
  -no-trace              Do no call tracing mechanisms. This debugging option is
                         used for testing the detection of the regions of interests.
                         (experimental)
  -indices <list>        Trace the indicated executions (starting at 1). e.g.
                         if tracing a region of interest defined by a starting
                         address, and list=3,5 , it will generate a trace
                         when that address is reached a third and fifth time.

This example directory contains the following subdirectories:

1. Sampling: step by step example on how to sample an application and show
   different sampling information.

2. Snippet: step by step example on how to extract snippets (i.e. code execution
   paths) from a given application and convert them into a self executable
   microbenchmark.

3. Clustering: step by step guide on how to profile in detail a function within
   an application and perform cluster analysis to know which invocation or set
   of invocations are the most representatives ones.

4. Tracing: step by step guide on how to trace a particular function invocation
   and convert it into a self executable microbenchmark.

To execute the examples, do the following:

# Setup the chop environment
> source <INSTALL_DIR>/share/chopstix/setup.sh

# Go to the example directory
> cd <INSTALL_DIR>/share/chopstix/examples/<EXAMPLE>

# Execute the step by step guide
> ./tryme.sh
